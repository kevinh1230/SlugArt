Privacy Settings
Through settings in the SlugArt mobile application, you can choose whether to accept
Scratchers only from users you have added to your friends list, or from any other
SlugArt user who determines your username. If you choose to receive Scratchers only
from your friends, and a user who is not on your friends list attempts to send you a
Scratcher or add you as a friend, you will receive a notification and have the option of
adding the user to your friends list.
You also have the ability to delete users from your friends list or to block specific users at
any time by using controls within the SlugArt mobile application.
Account Information
You may update or correct information about yourself by launching the SratchPix mobile
application and editing your account settings
Device Information
Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and
image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a Scratcher in your photo
gallery). If you choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native
phonebook will be transmitted to SlugArt. Although you may decide whether or not to
use these features, on Android devices you grant SlugArt you later decide to revoke
this permission, you can do so by following the standard uninstall process and removing
the SlugArt mobile application from your device. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you
can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access
your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device.
